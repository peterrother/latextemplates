# latextemplates

This is a repository of LaTeX templates that I use often. [LaTeX](https://github.com/latex3/latex3) is extremely powerful for typesetting and creating beautiful documents.

To install all the tools you need on macOS, all you need is [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) and a quick one-line install:

```shell
brew install basictex
```

After that and once you have written your content in the .tex file, simply run this command to generate a PDF.

```shell
pdflatex mydoc.tex
```

Happy LaTeXing!
